# Changelog

## 0.3.100

This version re-purposes Ryubook as a .NET Tool, similar to [MDBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), and is now compatible with .NET Core 3.1 for a limited time. Finally, Ryubook now includes a ``detect`` command that is used to determine if ``pandoc`` is installed or not.
